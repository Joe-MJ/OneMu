# OneMu
**One** 萬 **Mu** 目 Computer Vision Library  
**萬** (One) means ten thousand and a lot.  
**目** (Mu) means eyes.  
We focus on developing simple and fast vision frameworks especially for real-time vision applications.  
The library is made by pure C and hence easy to be ported into cross-platforms.
